/**
 * Operation protocol coverage — a test contract, never a runtime authority.
 *
 * One row per `AgentTeamOperation['kind']`, closed at compile time by the
 * `Record<...>` annotation below: adding or dropping a kind in the union fails
 * typecheck until this table declares its row. Each row pins the five surfaces
 * that express that kind's protocol:
 *
 * - `stored` round-trips through the durable Zod schema, and is typed against
 *   the union member, so a required field added to the type breaks its fixture;
 * - `retry` drives the kind's real public request path twice: the same request
 *   id must resolve the stored record (running the request comparator and the
 *   committed-result mapper exactly as production does), and a mutated payload
 *   under that id must collide;
 * - `legacy` declares which load stage may rewrite the record (`normalize`
 *   vs prior-projection `repair`), verified behaviorally as rewrite/identity;
 * - `intent` declares the change-scope and Inbox effect, so an intentional
 *   no-op is a stated row rather than an empty-looking omission.
 *
 * Deliberately not covered here: projection apply, change-scope derivation,
 * thread-ref indexing and replay validation keep their own suites. These
 * fixtures are durable *shapes*, never a replayable history — which is why
 * retry coverage injects the stored record under its request id instead of
 * committing it: the idempotent branch reads `byRequest` before any
 * authorization or projection work, so comparator and mapper run against the
 * protocol shape without fabricating a valid ledger history around it.
